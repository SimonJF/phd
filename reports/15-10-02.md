# 15-09-18 Weekly Report

## What I had planned to do this week
* **Not** work on the scheduler again
* Work on Links module system
* Read Script Writer's Dream & Row-based Effect Types for Database Integration
* Hopefully start thinking about designs for statically-typed session
  actors.


## What I actually did this week
* Worked on the scheduler again (d'oh!) -- but got it finished
* Various tidbits for SPLS
* Worked on Links module system, but not quite completed it
* Met with Phil (Tues) and Sam (Thurs) to discuss Actual Research
* Took far too many coffee breaks
* Attended Phil's lecture, lunches, that sort of stuff

## What I will do next week
* Weekend:
  * At least basic, one-file, inefficient-ish module system
  * Tutorial preparation
* Week:
  * More tutorial preparation
  * 1 day max on more Links hacking, but research *really* has to start
    just after that
  * Look more into the relationship between actor- and channel-based
    models of concurrency. In particular, implement both in terms of
    each other. Maybe a formal translation?
  * See how session types interact with the translation.

* To read:
  * Behavioural types for actor systems TR
  * A-pi paper
  * Hopac actors vs channels documentation
  * Links papers -- even if just a skim
  * More of a look at Gul Agha's book

## Have I made enough progress this week?
Perhaps, but not quite.

## Have I worked hard enough this week?
No. Better planning / concentration needed next week.
