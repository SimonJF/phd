# 15-10-09 Weekly Report

## What I had planned to do this week
* Weekend:
  * At least basic, one-file, inefficient-ish module system
  * Tutorial preparation
* Week:
  * More tutorial preparation
  * 1 day max on more Links hacking, but research *really* has to start
    just after that
  * Look more into the relationship between actor- and channel-based
    models of concurrency. In particular, implement both in terms of
    each other. Maybe a formal translation?
  * See how session types interact with the translation.

* To read:
  * Behavioural types for actor systems TR
  * A-pi paper
  * Hopac actors vs channels documentation
  * Links papers -- even if just a skim
  * More of a look at Gul Agha's book


## What I actually did this week
* Got a *very* basic module system, but more still to be done.
* A *ton* of teaching prep.
* Worked through Hopac chan -> actor translation
* Started defining two formal calculi + type systems: lambda-ch and
  lambda-act; lambda-ch is a lambda calc with channel primitives,
  whereas lambda-act is a lambda calc with actor primitives.
* Proofread Jack's draft
* A *ton* of reading:
  * Crafa TR (Behavioural types for actor systems)
  * lambda-fut paper (A Concurrent Lambda Calculus with Futures)
  * A-pi paper
  * Hopac actor/chan docs
  * Behavioural Types for NUMA (Franco & Drossopoulou)
  * Lightweight Functional Session Types
  * Some papers in prep for cwk2

## What I will do next week
* Lots of cwk2 prep
* Tutorial prep
* Finish lambda-ch and lambda-act definitions by ~Tuesday, do
  translations hopefully on Wednesday, start thinking about session
  types.
  * Should probably prove both correct too...
* Start thinking about where session types fit into these

## Have I made enough progress this week?
I think so.

## Have I worked hard enough this week?
I think so.
