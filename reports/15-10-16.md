# 15-10-09 Weekly Report

## What I had planned to do this week
* Lots of cwk2 prep
* Tutorial prep
* Finish lambda-ch and lambda-act definitions by ~Tuesday, do
  translations hopefully on Wednesday, start thinking about session
  types.
  * Should probably prove both correct too...
* Start thinking about where session types fit into these

## What I actually did this week
* Lots of tutorial prep
* Worked on lambda-ch and lambda-act. Both make sense now, have
  semantics, and there's the basics of a translation between lambda-ch
  and lambda-act. Still a bit more work to do.
* Finished organising SPLS

## What I will do next week
* Weekend + Monday: Coursework 2 prep, now that I have the basic spec,
  and tutorial prep
* Tuesday: Research? More on lambda-ch and lambda-act, probably
* Wednesday: SPLS --- whole day
* Thursday: Tutorial prep / cwk 2 refinement / research
* Friday: Teaching

Main thing I want to achieve next week research-wise: complete lambda-ch
and lambda-act, translations between the two, and start working on the
preservation proofs.

## Have I made enough progress this week?
Not quite; but then again maybe my goals were too ambitious.

## Have I worked hard enough this week?
Yes (apart from maybe Wednesday).
